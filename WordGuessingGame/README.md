## Pseudocode

### **Game Initialization**
1. Define the list of possible words.
2. Randomly select a word for the current round.
3. Initialize state variables:
    - `guessesLeft` â†’ The number of incorrect guesses allowed.
    - `currentWord` â†’ The word being guessed (displayed as underscores).
    - `guessedLetters` â†’ An array to track the letters guessed by the player.
4. Render the initial game state:
    - Display underscores for the word.
    - Display the UFO, beam, and astronaut.

### **Player Guess Logic**
1. When a player clicks a letter:
    - Check if the letter has already been guessed.
    - If not guessed:
        - Add the letter to `guessedLetters`.
        - Check if the letter exists in `currentWord`.
            - **If correct**: Reveal the letter in the word.
            - **If incorrect**: Decrement `guessesLeft` and increase the beamâ€™s opacity.
2. Check for win or loss:
    - **Win Condition**: All letters in the word have been guessed.
    - **Loss Condition**: `guessesLeft` reaches 0.

### **Rendering**
1. Update the word display with correctly guessed letters.
2. Update the visual state of the UFO, beam, and astronaut based on `guessesLeft`.
3. Display appropriate messages for win/loss.

### **Restart Game**
1. Reset all state variables to their initial state.
2. Randomly select a new word.
3. Re-render the initial game state.

### **Hint Functionality**
1. When the hint button is clicked:
    - Display an image or clue related to the word.
    - Disable the hint button after use.
